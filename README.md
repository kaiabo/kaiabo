Hi, I'm Kaia!

I am a fourth-year computer science student at Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, specializing in visual computing. My motivation lies in problem-solving and being able to develop creative, innovative solutions. Among my main interests are machine learning, data analysis and game- and software development. Alongside my studying, I wish to work on smaller coding projects to learn new technologies and gain more experience in developing.
