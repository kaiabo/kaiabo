Hi, I'm Kaia!

I am currently in my third year of a masters degree in computer science at Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. As of now, my main interests in programming is machine learning, data analysis and game- and software development, and my goal is to be able to do smaller coding projects alongside my studying. My main focus is to learn new technologies and build interesting projects!
